          <h1>Hi There!</h1>
          <p>
            I'm Filipe. I'm a Software Engineer, but you can know all about my
            education, skill, and experience by checking the rest of my
            portfolio. Here I want to give some informal insights into who I am.
          </p>
          <p>
            Born and raised in Brazil, I came to the US in my early 20s. My
            first language is Portuguese, but I taught myself Spanish growing up
            and English later on.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not working on some personal projects or studying you can
            find me at the gym lifting some weights, reading a book, enjoying a
            conversation, or playing a game.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aside from being a Geek, I enjoy traveling, cultures, dancing,
            Indian food, self-motivation books, international relations,
            history, and nature.
